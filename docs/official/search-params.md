# Search Params Example

This example demonstrates how to read and write the URL query string using the `useSearchParams()` hook. This hook is similar to the `useNavigate()` hook, but just for the [search portion of the URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/search).

In this example, we have a form to search for a user on GitHub and display their user profile.
